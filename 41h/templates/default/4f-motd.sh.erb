         Don't fuck it up. Share shit with wemux, and don't be a dick.

 Rather than using vanilla 'tmux', please use the 'wemux' wrapper script. This
 allows for multiple users to share sessions by simply attaching to the named
 session for the given user. Check out the documentation at the following URL
 for more information:

 Enjoy!
