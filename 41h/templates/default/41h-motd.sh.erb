 Jupyter notebook is installed and running at http://127.0.0.1:8888 use SSH
 port forwarding to access this remotely (to mitigate the need for SSL).

 Rather than using vanilla 'tmux', please use the 'wemux' wrapper script. This
 allows for multiple users to share sessions by simply attaching to the named
 session for the given user. Check out the documentation at the following URL
